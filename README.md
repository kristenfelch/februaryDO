# Package Dependency Management Challenge : 0.1.0

## Features

1. All Tests Passing with regard to test harness with low concurrency.

## Future Plans

### Required
1. Overall architectural plan for modularizing solution to remove single scriptlike file.
2. Testing files put in place side by side with business logic modules.
3. Connection management : Rate limiting, identifying spammy clients, solve for high concurrency case.
4. Input validation improvement using regex and sanitization.
5. Business logic algorithm optimized, DRY principle, made readable.
6. In memory data store and optimized locking - do we really need to lock the entire in memory cache?
7. Uniform logging system.
8. Documentation generated and included.
9. Automated integration testing in addition to unit tests that have been added, modeled after test harness.
10. Externalization of environment configuration.
11. Docker-ization of service.
  
## Versions
- 0.1.0 - Initial messy solution to pass test harness with low concurrency.
